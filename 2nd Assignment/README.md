# 2nd Assignment 

* Word ladder script implements a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the contraint tha each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word.    
    For example, here is a word ladder connecting "code" to "data".  
        code → core → care → dare → date → data    
      This script finds the minimal word ladder between two words if it exists. Several ADTs (Abstruct Data Types) will be used for this problem are
Vectors,Queues and Lexicon. This problem is an instance of a shortest-path problem and breadth-first-search will be used. That's why
queues will be needed because BFS is typically implemented by using a queue to store partial ladders that represent posibilities to explore.
